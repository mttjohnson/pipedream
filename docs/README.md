## Development and Demonstration

Notes on kicking the tires and [developing with this locally using Docker](local_dev.md)

Another idea for collaborative [development effort is to allow the use of a personal fly.io account](fly_dev.md) to spin up the pieces to test and iterrate with changes directly on fly.io instead of running in docker locally.



Demonstrations:

```bash
# List project commands
./run
just

# Run Demo from 2024-06-21
./run demo-2024-06-21

# Run Test Suite
just test
```
